"""The tracked-file privacy gate (#235).

The gate's original job was secret-shaped strings and forbidden paths. It missed a personal home
directory written as a string literal *inside* a tracked file, because it inspected which files
were tracked rather than what they said about someone's machine. That gap had two costs: a
contributor's username and machine layout committed to a public repo, and a portability bug the
same check would have caught for free — `Path("C:/Users/...")` is not absolute on POSIX, so it
silently creates a junk `./C:/Users/...` tree instead of failing.

These tests exercise the pure scanning function directly, so a case can be added without a
throwaway git repository.
