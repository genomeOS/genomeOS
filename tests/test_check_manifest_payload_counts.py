"""Tests for scripts/check_manifest_payload_counts.py.

The check exists because a merged manifest recorded 25 candidates for a query that matched 58, and
nothing about the file looked wrong (#272). So the tests that matter are the ones that feed it the
disagreement and watch it refuse — a check whose removal breaks no test is the defect #299 records.

Every fixture is built in `tmp_path`; the committed corpora are read, never edited.
