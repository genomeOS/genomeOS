The Data [working group](../../contribute/#working-groups) expands geographic evidence through exact publication measurements and
compatible database transfers. More rows are useful only when their meaning survives extraction.

## Never infer a required field from plausibility

An agent or human must not invent a coordinate, uncertainty radius, denominator, counted allele,
sampling design, disease exclusion, cohort identifier, date, or source locator. Nearby place names,
typical study practice, and values in a secondary compilation are not substitutes for source
evidence.

If a field is not supported, preserve it as unresolved in the publication review ledger. Do not
promote the row into the validated observation store.

## Anchor every claim

Publication work records an immutable source record, citation, exact table/figure/page/supplement
locator, verbatim population label, verbatim printed frequency, and field-level evidence. A note can
explain a caveat but cannot replace a structured field.

Reuse status is checked and recorded. When no restriction is found after a documented check, use
`no_restriction_found`; lack of an explicit license does not automatically discard valuable data.
Explicit restrictions still control.

## Keep database transfers source-aware

[The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/), the
[1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org/), the
[Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP)](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/hgdp),
the [Allele Frequency Net Database (AFND)](https://www.allelefrequencies.net/), national resources,
and other datasets differ in geography, how participants were recruited, samples, and access
terms. A continental genetic-analysis group is not a geographic observation. The same study group
must not be counted twice when it appears in more than one source.
