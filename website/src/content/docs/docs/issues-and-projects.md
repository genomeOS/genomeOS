GitHub Issues record both work and decisions. The
<a href="https://github.com/orgs/genomeOS/projects/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project board</a> shows how that work moves.

## Before starting

1. Introduce yourself in <a href="https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/discussions/76" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discussion #76</a>.
2. Search <a href="https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues?q=is%3Aissue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open and closed issues</a>.
3. Choose an issue marked `Ready`, or open a scoped issue for triage.
4. State objective, acceptance evidence, public interface, assumptions, refusal conditions, and downstream consumers.
5. Work on a branch and open a pull request; never commit directly to `main`.

When posting a substantive issue update, mention the original issue author so they receive the
context they asked for.

## Labels and status

Every issue carries `type:*`, `P*:`, `skill:*`, and `priority:*` labels. Priority follows the
dependency graph. `Ready` means fully specified and unblocked. `needs-human-decision` means an
agent must present the choice and stop. `wants-expert-review` means implementation can proceed but
the pull request must name what an expert should evaluate.
