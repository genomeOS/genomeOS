# Paired B0/B0H reporting

The local reporter describes B0H minus B0 on matching withheld evidence. It
advances #211 and #189 WP1/WP4; the real comparison campaign remains incomplete.
It does not fit models or establish a model winner, external generalization,
resident-population performance, geographic prediction, joint LD, or publication
eligibility. Source populations and adjacent variants are dependent evidence.

Create a `pairs.json` with `schema_version: 1` and a `pairs` list containing all24
combinations of `cohort_stage` (`technical_qc_4117`,
`paper_ancestry_exclusion_4094`), `count_kind` (`called`, `quality`), `seed`
(42, 43, 44), and `rho_prior_beta` (9, 4). Each record also supplies
`b0_directory` and `b0h_directory`, resolved relative to that JSON file. Reuse the
same B0 directory across the two prior tracks. For example, one record is:

```json
{
  "cohort_stage": "technical_qc_4117",
  "count_kind": "called",
  "seed": 42,
  "rho_prior_beta": 9,
  "b0_directory": "publications/b0/technical_qc_4117/called/42",
  "b0h_directory": "publications/b0h/technical_qc_4117/called/42/9"
}
```

Run with the repository's locked environment and fresh output directories:

```bash
python scripts/compare_reference_counts.py --pairs pairs.json --out paired-report
python scripts/plot_reference_comparison.py --report paired-report/report.json --out paired-figure
```

The comparison CLI writes `report.json` and a manifest containing input, source,
package, and output fingerprints. Exit 0 and `matrix_complete: true` in both the
report and manifest require all24 publication pairs to be available **and** all
five folds completed in both models for every pair. `available_pair_count`
separately records validated publication availability; it can be24 while the
matrix remains scientifically incomplete. Exit 2 can mean a valid incomplete
matrix (absent directories, failed/infeasible folds, or no common completed
folds), or an input error (consult stderr and whether a report was produced).
A present partial or corrupt publication is a hard error. Scientific fold failures remain valid
reported evidence and are distinct from absent publications. Availability of all
publications does not mean all folds succeeded: inspect each comparison's
`comparison_complete`, `full_pair`, and `completed_fold_conditional` fields.

The figure has separate tracks for both priors and retains every identity.
Complete pairs use all five folds. Explicitly labelled conditional pairs use only
folds completed in both models; no-common-fold pairs and missing publications
retain visible rows without numbers. AN0 rows remain unavailable in the report;
they are never zero-frequency observations. The report also retains original
fold failures, support counts, exclusions, both model summaries, and cell-level
contrasts.

All differences are **B0H minus B0**. MAE, RMSE, and interval widths have frequency
units; integrated log score uses natural-log units; coverage differences are
percentage points. The figure shows MAE, log score, and all three coverage/width
levels (50%, 80%, 95%). RMSE remains in the report. Narrower intervals alone do not
establish improvement. Infinity and -Infinity are printed as text without a
finite-axis marker; two negative-infinite log scores produce
`undefined: both_negative_infinity`. No confidence intervals treat seeds or
linked variants as independent observations.

The plotting CLI produces `comparison.png` and `receipt.json`. The receipt
records `input_report` (exact file bytes), `decoded_report` (JSON bytes),
`input_encoding` (`json` or `gzip`), plotting source hash, package versions, PNG hash,
all identities/statuses, and each plotted value, unit, and artist identifier.
Full fold membership ledgers remain in the source report; the receipt binds them
through the decoded-report fingerprint without duplicating them.
Neither CLI overwrites an existing output directory. Retain private reports and
receipts locally; never commit real counts, posteriors, predictions, or private
research paths.

## Synthetic demonstration and regeneration

The committed [report](figures/reference_comparison_synthetic_report.json.gz) is
an 87,238-byte deterministic gzip representation of the exact matrix-CLI JSON
from tiny hand-set synthetic publications. Decoding preserves every byte of the
full provenance and fold/cell ledgers; no scientific fields are projected away.
The plotting CLI accepts ordinary JSON and explicitly decompresses `.gz` inputs
before validation. Corrupt gzip input is refused before any output is written.
The example contains 17 complete pairs, four conditional pairs, two wholly failed pairs, and one
absent pair. No real data or model fitting produced these examples.

![Synthetic reporting demonstration, not a model-performance result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/main/docs/figures/reference_comparison_synthetic.png)

Regenerate the image **directly from the committed report**, using a new output
directory each time:

```bash
python scripts/plot_reference_comparison.py \
  --report docs/figures/reference_comparison_synthetic_report.json.gz \
  --out /tmp/genomeos-paired-synthetic-figure
```

The committed [receipt](figures/reference_comparison_synthetic_receipt.json)
binds both the compressed-file and decoded-report fingerprints to the PNG and
source bytes. To regenerate the underlying synthetic publications and report:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=.:tests python tests/reference_comparison_figure_synthetic.py \
  --out /tmp/genomeos-paired-synthetic-inputs
python scripts/compare_reference_counts.py \
  --pairs /tmp/genomeos-paired-synthetic-inputs/pairs.json \
  --out /tmp/genomeos-paired-synthetic-report
```

The latter command deliberately returns 2 because one requested directory is
absent. The test below rebuilds these synthetic inputs, checks exact committed
compressed metadata and decoded report bytes, independently replays all 192
plotted values/states and all24 identity labels against actual Matplotlib artists, and checks output hashes and
input/overwrite refusals:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_plot_reference_comparison.py
```

To reproduce the compact representation from the generated report, use gzip
level 9, modification time 0, and an empty filename. This excludes timestamps and
local paths from the header. The code uses an exclusive new output file:

```bash
python - <<'PYCODE'
import gzip
from pathlib import Path

report = Path("/tmp/genomeos-paired-synthetic-report/report.json")
with report.with_suffix(".json.gz").open("xb") as output:
    with gzip.GzipFile(filename="", mode="wb", fileobj=output, compresslevel=9, mtime=0) as stream:
        stream.write(report.read_bytes())
PYCODE
```

The original plaintext report can be inspected locally after decompression; the
committed gzip contains the exact original schema-valid JSON, not an alternative
scientific summary. The tests compare decoded bytes to freshly generated CLI
output and verify byte-identical figures from plain and compressed inputs.
