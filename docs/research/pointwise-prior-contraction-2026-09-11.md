# Pointwise prior normalization for surface support

Issue [#266](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/266) repairs the denominator of the
Atlas support statistic. Posterior contraction now compares the posterior standard deviation of
latent frequency at each cell with the approximate latent prior standard deviation at that same
cell. The old scalar came from the first observation location. For finite HSGP and inducing
representations, marginal prior uncertainty can vary with the basis or inducing geometry, so a
different location's denominator can report apparent learning even when the local distribution
has not changed.

![Geography-aware pointwise-prior normalization counterexample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/main/docs/figures/prior_normalization.png)

The figure is a conditional no-update counterexample, not a fitted genetic surface. Its first panel
shows the chain from evidence geography to approximation geometry: 684 retained public MAP HbS
survey coordinates are small dots, while the background maps distance from each land cell to the
nearest of the 64 retained model locations shown as white-ring circles. Measured allele frequencies
do not enter the calculation. The input CSV has SHA-256
`ab92edd3059aa59a37f3e2d10361d67e490c573fc3c03bf13eb902e3820e98fd`, matching the committed
data-store inventory. A deterministic, vectorized maximin calculation selects
64 geographically balanced resolution-4 cells that contain surveys. Their centers are passed
through the production H3 placement at the same budget, which keeps the model locations collocated
with those survey-supported cells. This is a figure-only stability measure while the production
placement tie problem remains tracked in #280. The same model-location rings are repeated over the
second panel, which maps the resulting scalar-normalization error, and the third verifies that the
error follows distance to those computational locations while the corrected local ratio remains
one. Country boundaries provide orientation but do not enter the kernel: it has no political,
terrain, coastal or ecological covariate. The map evaluates 414 resolution-2 H3 land cells,
with ocean cells absent rather than covered by an artificial rectangular field. The Matérn-5/2
lengthscale is 1,500 km, amplitude is 1,
production jitter is applied, and the intercept is `Normal(-3.5, 1.5)`. An independent covariance
solve and 256-point Gauss-Hermite quadrature calculate the approximate prior frequency SD at every
evaluation cell. The numerical prior-SD ratio is not allele frequency or population structure.

The hypothetical posterior SD equals each cell's local prior SD. The old scalar denominator is
fixed to the displayed survey nearest the regional center, representing the scalar reference used
by the retired implementation. The figure annotates how many of 414 land cells falsely cross the
0.9 support threshold; every cell has ratio 1.0 with the matched local denominator. Red cell
borders show exactly where the old rule invented support. Four distant controls remain `unknown`
by the unchanged distance rule; they are tested but omitted from this regional figure because they
do not explain the normalization error.

The production interface samples the retained PyMC model's existing `freq_pred` node at requested
coordinates. This includes the model's actual hyperpriors and HSGP or inducing geometry. The
protocol identifier is `pointwise_approximate_latent_v1`: 500 draws, the fit's explicit seed, and
population SD (`ddof=0`). Tests compare this interface with direct prior sampling on actual HSGP
and inducing graphs, including replay, order, batching, saved-fit reload, and model-data
restoration after success and failure.

New fit caches use format 2. Known owner-produced format-1 caches are reconstructed from their
retained posterior and predictive graph without refitting or rewriting the source cache; unknown
or incomplete structures refuse. New surface artifacts use format 3 and store the full-precision
per-cell denominator plus protocol metadata. Formats 1 and 2 remain readable as historical
artifacts without inferring new fields for them. Plot caches use format 2 and bind arrays to
the exact ordered H3 indexes and coordinates; incompatible caches remain untouched and require a
new path.

The denominator is a finite Monte Carlo estimate and therefore has sampling error. This repair
does not restore the inducing approximation's omitted `K-Q` covariance, evaluate the effect on a
real map, or establish calibrated fitted uncertainty. Those claims require the separate WP2
reference checks.

The geography-aware figure revision passed its two focused tests, the 40-check smoke suite,
Ruff, frozen-contract, module-size and private-file gates, and the full repository suite with
2,855 passed and 30 optional-tool skips. The committed PNG was visually inspected after generation.
