Read the complete supplied 11-page PDF, including methods, risk-factor sections, conclusions,
funding/disclosures and all 84 bibliography entries. Visually inspected the methods page 2362,
Central Illustration on 2363, and both tables on 2364. Reading a bibliography entry is not
reading its cited paper; the detailed GBD methods and linked regional almanac are not included
in this reading claim. The first whole-document extraction was truncated; separate page 1–4,
5–8 and 9–11 extractions were read completely afterward. Publisher web access returned 403;

## Scientific contract

**Objective:** identify transferable measurement, uncertainty and validation practices, and
candidate ancillary sources that might improve independently tested resident-AF predictions.
**Output/acceptance:** traceable source-specific hypotheses and tests below; later covariate
admission still requires qualified access/support and incremental held-out AF performance.
**Component/interface:** this research note and WP0/WP1/WP3/WP7 plan clarifications only;
no production schema, fitter, data-ingestion or serving change.
**Assumptions/refusals/consumers:** the article concerns disease burden and modifiable risks,
not genotype counts or an AF reconstruction experiment. Its modeled estimates cannot become
observed alleles, geographic ground truth, ancestry labels or demonstrated migration. The
next consumers are source qualification, benchmark design, and separately governed burden work.

## What the article establishes

- **Measurement structure (pp 2361–2362):** GBD describes estimates over 204 countries and
  territories, organized across geographic levels and stratified by age and sex. Mortality
  inputs include vital registration and household surveys; disease incidence/prevalence use
  clinical definitions; risk exposures use population-representative surveys and surveillance.
  The article reports uncertainty intervals and cites GATHER.
- **Different quantities (p 2362; Central Illustration; Tables 1–2):** DALYs combine years of
  life lost and years lived with disability. Attributable fractions combine exposure, relative
  risk and a theoretical minimum-risk comparison. The illustration uses age-standardized
  DALY rates; the text says DALY rates are otherwise all-ages unless specified. Tables report
  deaths and DALY counts.
- **Candidate context (pp 2362, 2365–2368):** ambient particulate pollution, household solid-fuel
  exposure, lead and temperature accompany metabolic and behavioral risks. The article discusses
  exposure duration, cumulative LDL exposure, and moderate nonoptimal temperatures as well as
  extremes. It does not demonstrate that any of these improves allele-frequency prediction.
- **Measurement can move without the same movement in disease (pp 2367–2369):** incomplete
  detection, unequal treatment access, and disrupted care during COVID-19 complicate the
  interpretation of recorded diagnoses and hospitalizations.
- **Uncertainty must stay visible (Table 2, p 2364; lead section, p 2368):** the printed lead-related
  attributable-death/DALY uncertainty intervals include negative lower limits. The prose uses CI
  and the tables UI.

This is a high-level methods overview plus prevention review, not a reproducible operator
architecture, genetic model, or independently validated fine-resolution AF dataset. It refers
the detailed estimation methods elsewhere. Neither its graphics nor its bibliography certify
the benchmark we need.

## Consequences for our plan — proposed by genomeOS, not paper findings

1. **Keep the target fixed.** Evaluate AF against qualified held-out allele counts and
   denominators. CVD burden depends on exposures, age structure, care, ascertainment and other
   factors; resemblance to a CVD map cannot validate genetic geography. An eventual disease
   model needs independently supported effect/penetrance, exposure and denominator components.
   The paper's deaths, DALYs, attributable fractions, counts, rates and denominators are not
   interchangeable for this purpose. Preserve the existing clinical golden tests and server-side
   trait restrictions.
2. **Separate three ancillary layer roles.** Environmental exposures are candidate covariates;
   care/screening variables are candidate observation-process descriptors; disease/metabolic
   estimates initially remain downstream/contextual outcomes. Any proposed use of the latter
   as AF predictors requires an explicit dependency/circularity analysis and separate ablation.
   genomeOS interprets the article's detection, treatment-access and COVID-disruption sections as
   reasons to test explicit observation-process hypotheses, not to apply automatic corrections to
   allele counts. This is not a blanket claim that predictive use is impossible, or a claim of
   causality.
3. **Record support, time and lineage before pixels.** Preserve native spatial/temporal units,
   observed versus modeled status, vintage, input lineage, uncertainty and missingness. Sampling
   or interpolating a country estimate onto fine H3 cells does not add local information. A
   model using upstream pooled data may already contain the evaluation evidence; audit that
   dependence before classifying an external resource as independent. The paper's estimates for
   every geography are not evidence of equally dense independent measurements everywhere. For the
   reported lead intervals, preserve the negative lower-limit source fact and investigate its
   upstream statistical meaning before use; do not silently clip it or reinterpret it as a
   possible negative observed count. Retain the author's CI and UI labels rather than inventing a
   statistical equivalence.
4. **Respect population composition.** Qualify age/sex coverage where supplied, and distinguish
   the actual resident target from an age-standardized comparison. Any reweighting requires
   documented sampling and population denominators, with prespecified sensitivity analyses.
   Missing age/sex metadata remains unknown, never a fabricated population composition.
5. **Add controlled admission tests, not mandatory layers.** For each qualified family compare
   the existing baseline, baseline plus the family, missingness/coverage-only, and spatially
   structured negative-control arms using the same outer folds, scored people and information
   cutoff. Fit preprocessing and tuning inside training partitions. Report performance by
   source support and sparsity alongside existing regional/rare-variant strata; do not choose
   strata or the winning layer from the sealed external set.
6. **Separate timescales.** Recent care/policy/pollution changes may affect observation and
   disease outcomes without identifying multigenerational allele dynamics. Treat historical
   exposures as uncertain, time-supported hypotheses; test selection separately from migration
   and drift. Contemporary risk maps do not justify backward extrapolation into deep time.
7. **Adapt the communication, not inferred precision.** The Central Illustration visibly marks
   unestimated places. genomeOS additionally needs distinct observation, inferred mean,
   uncertainty, support and validation layers. Keep native-support/denominator/standardization
   labels visible; do not reuse the paper's CVD color scale or imply disease risk from an AF map.

The bibliography provides concrete leads, without requiring them to outrank the existing

No new source is admitted by this note. The primary objective remains accurate, calibrated,
independently resolved allele frequency; disease burden is a separate downstream question.
