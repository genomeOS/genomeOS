# WBBC regional-count qualification — 2026-09-17

Issue: [#325](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/325)

Design: Atlas §§4, 6 and 7.1

## Decision

The public WBBC GRCh38 WGS frequency release is eligible for **source-isolated P1 ingestion** for
an explicit curated variant set. It is not eligible to be combined with PGG.Han, ChinaMAP, NyuWa
or CMDB while participant independence remains unresolved in
[#326](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/326).

Each retained variant produces four measured-observation rows: North, Central, South and Lingnan.
The rows retain the source denominators (448, 100, 8,070 and 126 alleles) and the disease-enriched
cohort ascertainment:

```text
sampling_design = convenience
disease_ascertainment_excluded = false
cohort_id = wbbc:wgs-frequency-release-v1
```

Central and Lingnan remain in the observation store despite their small denominators. Support and
prior-dominance rules decide whether a later model can render them; ingestion does not silently
drop or pool them.

## Count derivation

WBBC reports regional `AF` and `AN`, but not regional `AC`. The reviewed derivation is
nearest-integer `AF × AN`, admitted only when both controls hold:

1. reported global `AC` equals nearest-integer global `AF × AN`; and
2. every retained regional product is within 0.000005 of one integer.

The source's global genotype tallies provide a second independent check:
`RR + RA + AA = NS` and `RA + 2×AA = AC`. A violation of either identity is a hard error.

The full chr22 audit read the original VCF INFO strings for 1,091,904 records. Global
reconstruction matched reported `AC` on every record. The largest regional residual was
0.00000403 alleles. An earlier tabular audit export rounded frequencies to roughly six significant
digits and overstated that residual as 0.00425; it is not the acceptance evidence. The source also
has 324 records where `VQSLOD` is absent after `DP`. Because `VQSLOD` does not enter count
reconstruction, the adapter accepts that reviewed source layout while continuing to refuse other
INFO drift. It repeats both count controls on every retained record and labels the assay
`genome_frequency_reconstructed`.

## Geographic support

Region membership is transcribed from Cong et al. 2022 Supplementary Figure 1. Province geometry
comes from Natural Earth v5.1.1 `ne_10m_admin_1_states_provinces` (public domain), SHA-256
`22d0e3ad85eb3e27f17cabf8ba2d50e554fbc27a87796ff891d958185da62fb5`.

For each region, `scripts/plot_wbbc_regions.py` finds the minimax great-circle centre over all
member-province boundary vertices. The measured covering radius is rounded upward to the next
25 km. These are `location_type = inferred`; they are broad source supports, not claimed sampling
sites.

| Region | Representative coordinate | Measured radius | Stored radius | AN |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| North | 43.146298 N, 109.721579 E | 2,012.589 km | 2,025 km | 448 |
| Central | 32.235380 N, 118.341915 E | 343.134 km | 350 km | 100 |
| South | 28.503013 N, 109.420054 E | 1,290.252 km | 1,300 km | 8,070 |
| Lingnan | 23.876558 N, 110.815613 E | 647.817 km | 650 km | 126 |

The WGS cohort is highly imbalanced within these labels: Hunan and Jiangxi contribute 87% of WGS
samples. The release does not provide division-level counts, so the adapter does not invent a more
precise within-region location.

## Terms and privacy

The primary article is CC BY 4.0. The WBBC processed-frequency download page requests citation and
shows a general site copyright notice, but states no processed-data licence and no explicit
redistribution or commercial-use restriction. The completed summary-tier check is therefore
`no_restriction_found`, with `licence_not_stated` retained as a separate fact. Raw participant data
remain controlled and are outside this adapter.

The committed fixture is synthetic. No WBBC variant table, participant row or participant-linked
supplement is committed or published. The private participant supplement used to qualify aggregate
ascertainment was not used to build this adapter or figure and must remain private.

## Reproduction

```bash
python scripts/plot_wbbc_regions.py \
  --natural-earth /path/to/ne_10m_admin_1_states_provinces.geojson \
  --out-tsv docs/research/wbbc-regions-2026-09-17.tsv \
  --out docs/figures/wbbc-regions-2026-09-17.png
```

The generated TSV is byte-compared with the registry fixture in the test suite. Production builds
pass that reviewed TSV explicitly with `build_registry.py --wbbc-regions`; no coordinate or radius
has a runtime default.
