# Variant-normalization audit — first cytokine batch, 2026-09

Design: [`2026-09-10-variant-normalization-registry-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-09-10-variant-normalization-registry-design.md)
(§5 contract, §6 resolution pipeline). Registry: `data/registry/variant_normalization.tsv`.

**Who did the work.** Every row in this batch was resolved by an agent
(`agent:anthropic:claude-opus-5`) on 2026-09-11 UTC. Every value below was retrieved from a live
service in that session; nothing was recalled. All four rows are `verification_status: pending`
and stay that way until [#242](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/242) decides who may
verify an agent-resolved row. **Until they are verified the four loci are not eligible for a
coordinate-keyed external resource** (spec §9). That is enforced, not merely stated:
`normalized_identity` returns `None` for a **mapping** row — one whose `variant_id` differs from
its `normalized_variant_id` — unless it is both `resolved` and `verified`; an **identity** row is
exempt from that verification requirement (see "What verification is required of, and what it is
not," below), so the exporter gate refuses these four mapping rows today without also blocking the
already-published HbS identity row.

## Counts

The AFND cytokine corpus holds **60 distinct loci**, of which the Atlas publishes **4** (spec §2).
This batch is those 4, deliberately, so the refusal rate is measured before the rest is scheduled.

| State | Count | Which |
|---|---:|---|
| resolved (pending verification) | 4 | `cyt:il-6-174-c`, `cyt:il-10-1082-g`, `cyt:il-10-819-t`, `cyt:tnfalpha-308-a` |
| refused (`unresolved` row written) | 0 | — |
| not attempted (no row at all) | 56 | the unpublished remainder of the 60-locus corpus |
| **total cytokine loci** | **60** | |

Outside the cytokine corpus the registry also holds 1 self-identity row, `chr11-5227002-T-A`
(HbS), which is a coordinate already and required no external resolution.

The observed refusal rate for the published batch is **0/4**. That number is not a claim about the
remaining 56: this batch is the four most-studied promoter SNPs in the corpus, the loci with the
largest literature and therefore the easiest naming trail. The refusal rate on the tail should be
expected to be much higher, and the 0/4 here is close to worthless as an estimate of it.

`data/raw/afnd_frequencies.tsv` is not tracked in the repository, so the 60-locus denominator is
taken from spec §2 rather than recounted here. Anyone rebuilding the raw AFND pull should confirm
it before scheduling the follow-on.

## Method actually followed

Per locus, in order, exactly as spec §6 requires:

1. **Propose** — LitVar2 autocomplete (`https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/litvar2-api/variant/autocomplete/?query=…`),
   queried both by gene symbol and by the legacy name. LitVar2 proposes; it never decides.
2. **Resolve twice, independently** — Ensembl release 116 Variant Recoder
   (`https://rest.ensembl.org/variant_recoder/human/<rsid>`) and NCBI dbSNP build 157 RefSNP API
   (`https://api.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/v0/refsnp/<n>`, the same endpoint
   `scripts/fetch_external_variant_info.py` already uses). LitVar2 was **not** counted as the
   second resource: it is NCBI, so agreeing with dbSNP is not corroboration.
3. **Naming citation** — LitVar2's publication trail for the candidate rsID, then the abstracts of
   the first 200 PMIDs in that trail fetched through E-utilities `efetch` and searched for the
   literal legacy offset. A citation was only accepted if **the abstract prints the legacy name and
   the rsID together**, so the row does not rest on LitVar2's own text-mining decision.
4. **Palindromy** — checked per row. One of the four (`G/C`) is palindromic and is dealt with
   separately below.

Supporting placement evidence, used for the strand argument and for the naming sanity checks, came
from Ensembl 116 `lookup/symbol`, `lookup/id?expand=1` and VEP
(`https://rest.ensembl.org/vep/human/id/<rsid>`).

## Per locus

### `cyt:il-6-174-c` — IL-6 −174, printed `G/C` — **resolved, strand evidence required**

- **Candidate.** LitVar2 autocomplete for `IL6` returned `rs1800795`, named `c.-174G>C`, gene
  `IL6`/`IL6-AS1`, 2,896 PMIDs — the top hit by a wide margin. Querying the legacy name directly
  (`IL6 -174`) returned the same rsID plus `rs1800797` (`c.-597G>A`, a different offset) and one
  unassigned `c.-174G>C` entry with 3 PMIDs. No second rsID competes for the name.
- **Resolution 1 — Ensembl release 116 Variant Recoder:** `NC_000007.14:22727025:C:G`
  (`NC_000007.14:g.22727026C>G`), and a second alternate `:C:T`.
- **Resolution 2 — NCBI dbSNP build 157 RefSNP API:** `NC_000007.14:22727025:C:G` and
  `NC_000007.14:22727025:C:T` on GRCh38.p14. **The two agree exactly.**
- **Allele chosen.** `C>G`, the alternate the printed `G/C` pair selects. `C>T` is the same rsID's
  other alternate and is not this observation.
- **Normalized identity.** `chr7-22727026-C-G`.
- **Naming citation.** `pmid:25526459` (*Medicine (Baltimore)* 2014;93(28):e278) — "SNP in the IL-6
  gene rs1800795 (-174 G/C)". Corroborated by `pmid:37904417` (*Medicine* 2023;102(43):e35697) —
  "the IL-6 gene -174G/C locus (rs1800795)". Both are in LitVar2's trail for rs1800795, and both
  print the legacy name and the rsID in the same sentence.
- **Strand evidence (required — `G/C` is palindromic).** The round-trip has no discriminating power
  here at all: complementing `G/C` returns `G/C`. Strand was established from a **co-named,
  non-palindromic locus in the same numbering scheme**:
  - `pmid:10747905` (Terry, Loukaci & Green, *J Biol Chem* 2000;275(24):18138-44) names
    "-597G-->A, -572G-->C, -373A(n)T(n), -174G-->C" as one IL6-promoter haplotype scheme, so
    −597 and −174 are printed under a single convention.
  - LitVar2 maps the −597 name to `rs1800797`. Ensembl 116 Variant Recoder and dbSNP 157 both
    place rs1800797 at `NC_000007.14:22726601:A:G` — plus-strand reference **A**.
  - The literature's −597 pair `G/A` is **not** palindromic. Reading that scheme on the minus
    strand would print `C/T` there, a pair containing neither the reference allele nor the common
    alternate. Only the plus-strand reading is consistent. The scheme therefore prints plus-strand
    letters, and so does its −174 entry.
  - Independently: Ensembl 116 annotates IL6 (`ENSG00000136244`) on **strand +1**, and VEP reports
    rs1800795 as an `upstream_gene_variant` at **distance 174** from the canonical transcript
    `ENST00000258743` — the legacy offset measured along the plus strand.
- **The orientation is also settled without the naming convention**, using only data already in
  this repository plus the reference resource, which is what retires the convention as an open
  question. Under a minus-strand reading the allele the internal id calls minor — the `-c` suffix,
  assigned by `MINOR_ALLELE_RULE` in `genomeos/observations/sources/afnd_cytokines.py` — would map
  to plus-strand **G**, whose global frequency dbSNP 157 reports as **0.750** (TOPMED) and **0.859**
  (1000Genomes). The Atlas's own published observations for `cyt:il-6-174-c` give a median of
  **0.304** across **83** populations, with 1 of 83 above 0.6. A minus reading is irreconcilable
  with both figures; plus is the only orientation consistent with the data this project already
  publishes.
  - Spec §6 rejects frequency concordance as the **step-1** method, on the ground that it has no
    discriminating power near 0.5. That objection does not bite here: the two hypotheses sit at
    0.30 against 0.75–0.86, far from 0.5, so the comparison genuinely discriminates. It is used to
    corroborate **strand**, never to choose the rsID, and the citation-based argument above stands
    on its own regardless.
- **What this evidence still does not establish.** The letters were never checked against a
  published promoter sequence; no full text was retrieved. That is now a completeness gap rather
  than the load-bearing assumption it was, because two independent arguments — the −597 anchor and
  the frequency check — agree on plus.
- **Two honest wrinkles, recorded rather than smoothed over:**
  - GRCh38 carries **C** at chr7:22727026, so the literature's leading "G" is *not* the reference
    allele. The identical pattern holds at −597 (literature "G>A", reference A), which is what makes
    the strand argument self-consistent rather than alarming, but it is worth a reviewer's eye.
  - The legacy numbering is not internally consistent to the base: VEP distance is 174 for −174 but
    **598** for −597. The offset arithmetic was therefore used as corroboration, never as proof.
  - `pmid:22839439` writes the same locus as "G(-174)A of IL6 gene (rs1800795)" elsewhere in the
    same abstract as "G(-174)C of IL-6 gene" — it contradicts **itself**, not just every other
    source, which is a strictly better reason to exclude it than disagreement with the rest of the
    literature would be. It was not used, and it is a reminder that a single abstract is not
    sufficient.

### `cyt:il-10-1082-g` — IL-10 −1082, printed `A/G` — **resolved**

- **Candidate.** LitVar2 autocomplete for `IL10` returned `rs1800896`, named `c.-1082G>A`, 2,047
  PMIDs. Querying `IL10 -1082` returned only rs1800896 plus one unassigned entry (2 PMIDs). No
  competing rsID.
- **Resolution 1 — Ensembl 116 Variant Recoder:** `NC_000001.11:206773551:T:C`
  (`NC_000001.11:g.206773552T>C`); also `LRG_1230:3942:A:G` in gene orientation.
- **Resolution 2 — dbSNP build 157:** `NC_000001.11:206773551:T:C` on GRCh38.p14, alongside `T>A`
  and `T>G`. **The two agree exactly.**
- **Normalized identity.** `chr1-206773552-T-C` (the `T>C` alternate, selected by the printed pair).
- **Naming citation.** `pmid:29802545` (*World J Pediatr* 2018;14(6):594-600) — "IL10 gene rs1800896
  (- 1082A/G) polymorphism"; the same abstract names the −819 locus with its rsID, so one paper
  covers both IL-10 rows. In LitVar2's trail for rs1800896.
- **Strand.** `minus`. `A/G` is not palindromic, so the round-trip is decisive: only the minus-strand
  reading complements to the GRCh38 pair `T/C`. Consistent with Ensembl 116 annotating IL10
  (`ENSG00000136634`) on strand −1 and with dbSNP's gene-oriented `NG_012088.1:g.3943A>G`.
- **Naming sanity check.** VEP places the variant 1,058 bp upstream of the canonical transcript
  `ENST00000423557` — 24 bp short of the legacy 1,082. The −819 locus is short by the **same** 24 bp,
  so both legacy offsets imply one common TSS at chr1:206772470, and the 263 bp between the two
  variants equals 1082 − 819 exactly. Two independently proposed rsIDs reconciling to one implied
  TSS is strong corroboration that this pair is what the legacy names denote.

### `cyt:il-10-819-t` — IL-10 −819, printed `C/T` — **resolved**

- **Candidate.** LitVar2 autocomplete for `IL10` returned `rs1800871`, named `c.-819C>T`, 1,371
  PMIDs. Querying `IL10 -819` also surfaced `rs1800872`, but LitVar2 names that one `c.-592C>A` — a
  different offset, so the two are separable on the evidence rather than by preference.
- **Resolution 1 — Ensembl 116 Variant Recoder:** `NC_000001.11:206773288:A:G`
  (`NC_000001.11:g.206773289A>G`); also `LRG_1230:4205:T:C`.
- **Resolution 2 — dbSNP build 157:** `NC_000001.11:206773288:A:G` on GRCh38.p14, alongside `A>C`
  and `A>T`. **The two agree exactly.**
- **Normalized identity.** `chr1-206773289-A-G`.
- **Naming citation.** `pmid:29802545` — "IL10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at … rs1800871
  (- 819C/T)". The printed pair `C/T` matches the citation's pair exactly. In LitVar2's trail for
  rs1800871.
- **Strand.** `minus`. `C/T` is not palindromic; only the minus-strand reading complements to the
  GRCh38 pair `A/G`. Consistent with IL10 on strand −1 and with `NG_012088.1:g.4206T>C`.
- **Naming sanity check.** VEP distance 795 vs the legacy 819 — the same 24 bp shift as −1082.

### `cyt:tnfalpha-308-a` — TNF-α −308, printed `G/A` — **resolved**

- **Candidate.** LitVar2 autocomplete for `TNF` returned `rs1800629`, named `c.-308G>A`, 3,969
  PMIDs. Querying `TNF -308` returned **only** rs1800629.
- **Resolution 1 — Ensembl 116 Variant Recoder:** `NC_000006.12:31575253:G:A`
  (`NC_000006.12:g.31575254G>A`), plus six MHC alt-contig placements.
- **Resolution 2 — dbSNP build 157:** `NC_000006.12:31575253:G:A` on GRCh38.p14. **The two agree
  exactly** on the primary assembly.
- **Normalized identity.** `chr6-31575254-G-A`.
- **Naming citation.** `pmid:22749237` (*Cytokine* 2012;60(1):249-56) — the legacy name and the rsID
  are in the **title**: "Tumor necrosis factor -308 polymorphism (rs1800629) is associated with
  mortality and ventilator duration in 1057 Caucasian patients". In LitVar2's trail for rs1800629.
- **Strand.** `plus`. `G/A` is not palindromic; only the plus-strand reading matches the GRCh38 pair
  (a minus-strand reading would require `C/T`). Consistent with Ensembl 116 annotating TNF
  (`ENSG00000232810`) on strand +1.
- **Alt-contig hazard, recorded.** dbSNP 157 also places rs1800629 on six MHC alt contigs, and on
  `HSCHR6_MHC_COX_CTG1` the reference allele is **A**, not G. Only the primary-assembly placement is
  in the registry, and an alt-contig placement must never be substituted for it.
- **Naming sanity check.** VEP places the variant 311 bp upstream of the canonical transcript
  `ENST00000449264` (and 304 bp from `ENST00001140822`), so no current transcript start reproduces
  the legacy 308 exactly. The legacy TSS differs from the present annotation by a few bases. The
  offset was therefore not used as evidence for this row; the citation and the two agreeing
  placements are.

## Refusals

**None in this batch.** No locus reached a refusal condition: every candidate was unique on the
evidence, both resources agreed on every placement, every row has a citation that prints the legacy
name and the rsID together, and the one palindromic locus had independent strand evidence available.

Had any of those failed, the row would have been written as `unresolved` with `rsid`,
`normalized_variant_id` and `strand` empty and `refusal_reason` naming what was tried. The registry
records that state as a row precisely so the same dead end is not re-investigated; there is simply
nothing to record for these four.

## What verification is required of, and what it is not

Design §9 makes eligibility for a coordinate-keyed external resource depend on verification. Applied
to *every* row that reads as "no row may be used until a human signs it", which would have blocked
the already-published HbS artifact: `website/src/atlas/public-artifacts.json` declares `gnomad` and
`dbsnp` resources for `hbs-rs334`, whose row is `pending` because an agent authored it and an agent
may not verify on a human's behalf.

**Decided (maintainer, 2026-09-11): the verification requirement is scoped to rows that assert a
mapping.** `normalized_identity` requires `verification_status == "verified"` only when
`variant_id != normalized_variant_id`.

The distinction is about what the row claims, not about convenience:

- A **mapping** row — every cytokine row in this batch — claims that a legacy promoter name denotes
  a particular coordinate. A name was translated and a strand was chosen, and either can be wrong in
  a way an external annotation would silently inherit. That claim waits for verification.
- An **identity** row — `chr11-5227002-T-A` — claims nothing. Its `variant_id` already *is* the
  GRCh38 coordinate the adapter minted. There is no legacy name to mistranslate and no strand
  ambiguity that could matter, so there is nothing verification could check and nothing an external
  annotation could contradict.

Two alternatives were considered and **rejected**: marking the HbS row `verified` (re-commits the
exact violation corrected one round earlier — an agent asserting a human's inspection), and dropping
HbS's external resources (a user-visible regression to already-published output).

The four cytokine rows are unaffected: they are mapping rows, they are `pending`, and they remain
ineligible until [#242](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/242) settles who may verify
them. `tests/test_export_atlas_web.py::test_every_declared_external_resource_resolves_against_the_real_registry`
now joins the real allowlist to the real registry, so the next time a declared resource loses its
resolvable row — or a resource is declared for a locus still pending — a test fails rather than an
export.

## A boundary this branch gates but does not yet close

**Verifying a cytokine row will not, by itself, make that locus publishable with a gnomAD or
dbSNP resource.** The branch only ever consumes the registry as a gate, never as a source of the
coordinate it resolves to:

- `scripts/export_atlas_web.py`'s `_external_resources` calls
  `normalized_identity(variant_id, variant_registry)` solely to check `is None` — the
  `NormalizedIdentity.normalized_variant_id` and `.rsid` it returns on success are discarded, never
  read.
- The same function separately requires (`scripts/export_atlas_web.py`, the `if normalized !=
  variant_id:` check just below the registry gate) that the external resource's own declared
  `normalized_variant_id` equal the artifact's **internal** `variant_id` — e.g. `cyt:il-6-174-c` —
  verbatim. `website/src/atlas/contracts.ts:174-184` encodes the identical requirement client-side
  (`resource.normalized_variant_id !== value.variant_id`).

For an identity row such as HbS this is invisible, because `variant_id` already *is* the GRCh38
coordinate (`chr11-5227002-T-A`), so "matches the artifact" and "is a coordinate gnomAD/dbSNP can
be queried by" are the same requirement. For a cytokine row they are not: `variant_id` is the
internal locus id (`cyt:il-6-174-c`), not a coordinate, and the registry's resolved coordinate
(`chr7-22727026-C-G`, once `cyt:il-6-174-c` is `verified`) is a *different* string. So an allowlist
entry for that locus is stuck between two requirements that cannot both be satisfied at once:
declaring the registry's coordinate as the resource's `normalized_variant_id` fails the line-466
match against `variant_id`, and declaring the internal id instead to satisfy line 466 produces a
`normalized_variant_id` that is not a GRCh38 coordinate gnomAD or dbSNP (or their cached-payload
query identity check a few lines further down) will accept.

**What works today:** the registry gate refuses a declared external resource for any variant
lacking a usable — resolved, and (for a mapping row) verified — registry row. Identity rows such as
HbS attach external resources today because their `variant_id` already is the coordinate.

**What does not work today, even after #242 lands and a cytokine row is marked `verified`:** that
locus still cannot carry a gnomAD or dbSNP resource, because the exporter's `normalized !=
variant_id` check and its TypeScript twin key the match on the artifact's own `variant_id`, not on
the registry's resolved `normalized_variant_id`. Making a verified mapping row usable requires
changing both `scripts/export_atlas_web.py`'s `_external_resources` and
`website/src/atlas/contracts.ts:174-184` to check the resource against the *registry's* resolved
identity instead of (or as well as) the artifact's own `variant_id`. **That change is not made
here** — it is follow-on work, to be filed as a separate issue.

## What a verifier should check

1. ~~That Terry 2000 prints the IL-6 promoter sequence in the sense orientation.~~ **Retired.**
   The `cyt:il-6-174-c` strand no longer rests on the naming convention: the −597 anchor and the
   allele-frequency check above agree on plus independently of it.
2. That `pmid:29802545` is an acceptable naming citation for both IL-10 rows, given it is a single
   paper carrying both.
3. That the alternate-allele choice is right where the rsID is multi-allelic — rs1800795 (`C>G` vs
   `C>T`), rs1800896 (`T>C` vs `T>A`/`T>G`), rs1800871 (`A>G` vs `A>C`/`A>T`), and rs1800797 — the
   −597 anchor locus, not itself a row in this batch — which dbSNP build 157 also reports as
   multi-allelic (`A:C`, `A:G`, `A:T`); the strand argument above needs only its plus-strand
   reference allele (`A`), which holds regardless of which alternate is considered.
4. That the legacy-offset discrepancies (IL-10 −24 bp, TNF +3 bp, IL-6 −597 off by one) are
   acceptable as annotation drift rather than a sign that a different locus is meant.
