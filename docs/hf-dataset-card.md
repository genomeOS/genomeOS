# genomeOS Atlas data store

Working store for [genomeOS](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS) — an open atlas of human
genetic variation where every number can be traced back to the measurement behind it.

It holds three kinds of thing: **source tables** the pipeline ingests, **trained models**, and the
**published per-cell surfaces** those models produce.

> **This is interim storage.** The project's artifact home is GCS
> ([#33](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/33)); this dataset exists so the store lives
> in one addressable place until that is set up. Everything here is plain files, so the migration
> is a copy.

> **Nothing here is validated science yet.** No golden test has passed. Held-out validation of the
> HbS surface shows it predicting held-out surveys only marginally better than a global constant
> ([#109](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/109)). Treat these as pipeline outputs, not
> as results.

## How it was made

**`raw/afnd_populations.tsv`** — harvested from
[allelefrequencies.net](http://www.allelefrequencies.net) by
[`scripts/fetch_afnd.py`](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/blob/main/scripts/fetch_afnd.py),
in two public hops: `pop6001b.asp` lists every population as a `?pop_name=` link in one request,
and `pop6001c.asp?pop_name=<name>` prints the coordinate. 1,821 of 1,825 retained; the four
refusals print no coordinate at all. Coordinates are kept in AFND's printed sexagesimal
(`6º 25' S`) because the printed precision is what bounds them — `41º 0' N` is degree precision and
earns a ~78 km uncertainty floor, not an arcminute fix.

**`raw/afnd_frequencies.tsv`** — not ours. Redistributed by
[slowkow/allelefrequencies](https://github.com/slowkow/allelefrequencies) (MIT-licensed code),
scraped from AFND's public frequency search endpoints.

**`raw/map_*.csv`** — Malaria Atlas Project WFS layers `Explorer:HbS_Data` and `Explorer:G6PD_Data`,
by `scripts/fetch_map_hbs.py`. Open, no credentials.

**`store/fits/`** — `scripts/build_surfaces.py`. A binomial/beta-binomial likelihood over a
Gaussian process on the **unit sphere** (not lon/lat — a degree of longitude is 111 km at the
equator and 47 km at 65°N), with inducing points placed on an H3 geodesic grid, sampled with
numpyro NUTS. A fit that has not mixed is refused rather than published.

**`store/artifacts/`** — `scripts/publish_artifacts.py`, predicting each fit onto versioned H3
targets. Format-1 artifacts used a coarse Natural Earth land-centre mask. Format-2 artifacts use
population-positive cells from a pinned WorldPop grid and record that grid's source/version in the
manifest. Measured observations remain separate: an administrative centroid may lie outside
populated land and is not treated as a claim that people live in its exact H3 cell.

**`store/population/`** — an H3-resolution-4 population grid built from WorldPop's 2020 global
1 km mosaic plus its official Cook Islands raster. The supplement is fill-only: the primary mosaic
wins all overlaps, preventing double-counting. The sidecar records both source URLs and SHA-256
hashes, one added cell, and 17 ignored overlaps.

**`store/external/`** — normalized snapshots fetched from the public gnomAD and NCBI dbSNP APIs.
The browser exposes them only when a catalog item is an actual normalized variant and the cache's
variant/rsID exactly matches that item; phenotype, HLA, and KIR labels do not receive guessed links.

## Using it

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
import pandas as pd

path = snapshot_download("bschilder/genomeos-data", repo_type="dataset")
```

### The surfaces (start here)

```python
cells = pd.read_parquet(f"{path}/store/artifacts/chr11-5227002-T-A__v3__map-2026-08/cells.parquet")
print(cells.columns.tolist())
# ['h3_index', 'variant_id', 'post_median', 'post_mean', 'post_sd',
#  'q025', 'q975', 'q25', 'q75', 'support', 'posterior_contraction',
#  'dist_nearest_obs_km', 'model_version', 'data_version']
```

**Read the `support` column before the numbers.** It is the point of the whole design:

| `support`         | meaning                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `observed`        | a survey sits in this cell                                      |
| `interpolated`    | inferred, with data within twice the correlation range          |
| `unknown`         | no data close enough — **the model is not making a claim here** |
| `prior_dominated` | the posterior never moved off the prior                         |

```python
# Never aggregate without masking. A mean over unmasked cells is a mean over the prior.
claimed = cells[~cells["support"].isin(["unknown", "prior_dominated"])]
print(f"{len(claimed)}/{len(cells)} cells carry a claim")
print(claimed["post_median"].describe())
```

`dist_nearest_obs_km` travels with each row so you can apply a stricter threshold than ours
without refitting.

### The manifest

```python
import json
m = json.load(open(f"{path}/store/artifacts/chr11-5227002-T-A__v3__map-2026-08/manifest.json"))
# correlation_range_km, likelihood, lengthscale_sigma, n_observations, support_counts, ...
```

A fitted correlation range is meaningless without the prior that produced it, which is why the
manifest carries both. Artifacts are keyed `(variant_id, model_version, data_version)` and are
immutable: a refit publishes alongside rather than overwriting, so an older citation keeps
resolving.

### The observations

```python
pops = pd.read_csv(f"{path}/raw/afnd_populations.tsv", sep="\t")
freq = pd.read_csv(f"{path}/raw/afnd_frequencies.tsv", sep="\t")
# Join on population name — AFND's own public key, shared by both tables, so it is exact.
joined = freq.merge(pops, left_on="population", right_on="population")
```

Watch for two things that cost real data when missed: `n` carries **thousand separators**
(`"3,732"`), and `alleles_over_2n` is a **frequency, not a count** — allele counts are
reconstructed as `round(af * 2n)`.

### The fits — read this first

```python
from genomeos.surfaces.fit import load_fit          # genomeOS must be installed
fit = load_fit(f"{path}/store/fits/chr11-5227002-T-A.fit.pkl")
```

**A fit is a cache, not an artifact.** It is a pickled PyMC graph, so it is coupled to the exact
PyMC/pytensor versions that wrote it, and **pickle executes arbitrary code on load** — only load
files you trust. It is here because refitting costs ~20 minutes, not because it is archival. The
parquet is the durable form: 1.1 MB against a 121 MB fit, carrying everything a consumer needs.

## Provenance and terms

**This dataset is public.** AFND publishes no standalone licence — its "Licensing" link carries a
disclaimer rather than an explicit reuse prohibition, and re3data's "public domain" record is
third-party catalogue metadata. The project therefore records the source as
`no_restriction_found`: lack of a clearly stated licence does not by itself block valuable data,
while any explicit restriction discovered later still governs that source
([#117](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/117)).

[Issue #66](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/66) records the completed decision that
fitted surfaces derived from AFND, HGDP, SGDP, and AADR may be published with source attribution,
Biocultural Notices, measured/inferred separation, and explicit source restrictions preserved.
The [CARE Principles](https://www.gida-global.org/careprinciples)—Collective Benefit, Authority to
Control, Responsibility, and Ethics—remain a provenance and responsible-use framework, not a
standalone publication veto or substitute for source-specific terms.

## Known limitations

- **No golden test has passed.** §8's HbS parity test is blocked on population-weighted national
  aggregation.
- **Held-out skill is marginal.** Under spatially-blocked cross-validation the HbS surface scores
  MAE 0.0388 against a constant baseline's 0.0391 ([#109](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/109)).
- **HLA surfaces are not published here.** A screen of twenty alleles fitted correlation ranges of
  1,036–4,111 km — a range that long makes the field near-constant and indistinguishable from the
  intercept ([#122](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/122)).
- **One population can dominate.** AFND's DKMS German donor entry has `an` = 6,912,132, about
  23,000× the median; a binomial likelihood weights by `an`
  ([#123](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/123)).
- **G6PD is a phenotype, not a variant.** `phenotype:g6pd-deficiency` aggregates ~200 alleles
  assayed by enzyme activity ([#116](https://github.com/genomeOS/genomeOS/issues/116)).
