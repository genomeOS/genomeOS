# Local data and model store

What this project holds, where, and which parts are durable. Written because three separate pod
runs had their output destroyed, and because most of what the pipeline produces is deliberately
not in git.

## Layout

```
data/
  raw/                                  fetched sources — gitignored, re-fetchable by script
    map_hbs_surveys.csv                 scripts/fetch_map_hbs.py --layer hbs
    map_g6pd_surveys.csv                scripts/fetch_map_hbs.py --layer g6pd
    afnd_populations.tsv                scripts/fetch_afnd.py
    afnd_cache/                         one HTML page per AFND population, so a re-run is free
  curated/                              immutable, versioned operator-reviewed inputs
    map_hbs_surveys.csv                 HbS rows plus explicit bounding-disc support evidence
  store/
    fits/       <variant>.fit.pkl       trained models — a CACHE, not an artifact (see below)
    artifacts/  <variant>__<model>__<data>/
                  cells.parquet         the citable per-cell surface (§5, §6)
                  manifest.json         what was published, and under what assumptions
    INVENTORY.json                      checksums of everything above
reference/                              committed: Natural Earth countries (1:110m, and the 1:50m
                                        admin-0 source of the Atlas borders), Piel 2013 estimates
tests/fixtures/                         committed: tiny, hand-checkable inputs
docs/figures/                           committed: review figures
```

## What is durable and what is not

| | in git | re-creatable | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reference/`, `tests/fixtures/`, `docs/figures/` | **yes** | — | small, reviewable, diffable |
| `data/raw/` | no | **yes**, by script | sources are versioned upstream; a committed copy goes stale silently |
| `data/store/fits/*.pkl` | no | yes, by refitting | **~100 MB each** and environment-coupled |
| `data/store/artifacts/` | **yes** | yes, from a fit | 1.1 MB parquet per variant — the citable output |

## A fit is not an artifact

`surfaces.fit.save_fit` pickles the PyMC graph alongside the posterior so predictions are cheap to
repeat. That is a **cache**: pickle is coupled to the installed PyMC and pytensor, and it executes
arbitrary code on load, so it can be neither archival nor shared. It is also large — the HbS fit is
**121 MB** against a **1.1 MB** artifact, a 110x difference, because the posterior carries a draw
of `f`, `p` and `freq_pred` for every observation. The fits stay local; the artifacts are
committed.

The artifact is `store/artifacts/.../cells.parquet` — per-cell posterior summaries in plain
columns, readable by anything that reads parquet, and what §5 means when it says the read API
"reads precomputed artifacts and aggregates them; it never computes science".

Every row carries its `support` state, `posterior_contraction` and `dist_nearest_obs_km`. That is
not padding: §4's defence against a persuasive-but-unfounded cline is that a consumer can tell
measured from inferred without going back to the model, and the distance is carried so a stricter
threshold can be applied without refitting.

## Building the P4 serving catalog

P2 publishes one immutable directory per entity. The P4 API reads one version-pinned catalog and
must not infer labels, measurement meaning, eligibility, or assumptions from directory names.
Those reviewed decisions live in `data/store/catalog-metadata.json`; build a local serving catalog
with:

```bash
python scripts/build_atlas_catalog.py --source data/store/artifacts \
    --metadata data/store/catalog-metadata.json --out data/serving/atlas-v1
```

The command refuses to replace an existing output, validates entity IDs, row counts and H3
resolutions, adds only mechanical H3 centre coordinates, checks that the catalog pins exactly one
data/model version, and writes `manifest.json` last. Missing observations or burden artifacts stay
explicitly unavailable; the builder never manufactures them from a surface.

`contract/atlas_catalog.schema.json` is the frozen review surface for this serving boundary. Run
`python scripts/freeze_contract.py` after an intentional catalog-contract change.

## Building the static web export

The `/app/` explorer reads `website/public/data/atlas/`. `scripts/export_atlas_web.py` writes the
canonical, citable JSON (surface, observations and manifest per artifact, plus `catalog.json`).
`export_atlas_web.py` output is an intermediate; the site build fails until `encode_atlas_web.py`
has run:

```bash
python scripts/encode_atlas_web.py   # default --in and --out: website/public/data/atlas
```

The encoder takes the first artifact's H3 sequence as the shared grid and refuses any surface
whose cells differ, writes content-addressed GOSA objects under `grids/` and `surfaces/`, decodes
every object it wrote and compares it with the JSON cell by cell, and only then adds `grids`, `web`
and `observations_bytes` to `catalog.json`. It is byte-deterministic, so CI re-runs it and fails if
the committed catalog differs. The objects are git-ignored; the JSON stays the citable download.

The explorer's country borders are derived too. `scripts/encode_natural_earth_borders.py` reads
`reference/ne_50m_admin_0_countries.geojson`, refuses it unless its sha256 is the pinned
revision's, and writes the committed `website/public/data/atlas/ne-50m-admin-0.borders.bin`
(positions on a 0.0001° lattice, shared borders stored once; fast-load spec §B.10). A vertex that
rounding would move into another H3 cell is snapped back into its own, at every resolution of
`catalog.json`'s `grids`, so border heights over a surface are exact. The site no longer ships the
GeoJSON. Re-run the script after changing the source, the format or the catalog's grid
resolutions; `--check` fails when the committed file is stale, and the Python tests check it byte
for byte.

## Immutability is enforced, not just documented

Artifacts are keyed `(variant_id, model_version, data_version)` and `publish()` **refuses to
overwrite**. A refit publishes under a new `model_version` and coexists with what it supersedes,
so an older citation keeps resolving. A silent overwrite is exactly the failure that guarantee
exists to prevent.

## Rebuilding from nothing

```bash
python scripts/fetch_map_hbs.py --layer hbs  --out data/raw/map_hbs_surveys.csv
python scripts/fetch_map_hbs.py --layer g6pd --out data/raw/map_g6pd_surveys.csv
python scripts/fetch_afnd.py --out data/raw/afnd_populations.tsv --cache data/raw/afnd_cache

python scripts/build_surfaces.py --hbs data/curated/map_hbs_surveys.csv \
    --g6pd data/raw/map_g6pd_surveys.csv --out data/store/fits --draws 1200
python scripts/publish_artifacts.py --fits data/store/fits --out data/store/artifacts \
    --hbs data/curated/map_hbs_surveys.csv --g6pd data/raw/map_g6pd_surveys.csv
python scripts/store_inventory.py --root data --out data/store/INVENTORY.json
```

The HbS fetch command retains the untouched vendor export as raw evidence. That area-only export
intentionally fails the HbS adapter: an area class cannot establish a bounding radius from the
reported coordinate. A separately retained, immutable and versioned curated CSV must supply the
four fields defined in [the MAP spatial-support contract](map-spatial-support.md). There is no
automatic raw-to-curated conversion, and this repository does not currently contain or claim a
qualified real curated MAP source. For a runnable synthetic demonstration, use
`tests/fixtures/map_hbs_curated_synthetic.csv`.

Fitting is ~20 min per variant on a laptop. **Do not run it on a pod expecting the output back**:
nothing copies `/workspace` off a pod, and that is how three runs' fits were lost. A pod can render
figures and push them to a branch (`runpod_fit.py --job surfaces` does), but a 6 MB fit has to be
produced where it will be kept.

## Known gap

The **artifacts and the inventory are committed**, so a published surface now survives this
laptop. The **fits (217 MB) and the AFND harvest (36 MB of cached pages) are not** — they are
re-creatable by script, and `INVENTORY.json` makes their loss *detectable* rather than
*survivable*. Remote storage — #33 specifies GCS — is the actual fix and is not built.
