# A tracked file may not hard-code someone's home directory. There are two costs, and the second
# is the one that surprises people: it commits a contributor's username and machine layout to a
# public repo, *and* it is a portability bug this same check catches for free. `Path("C:/Users/x")`
# is not absolute on POSIX, where `pathlib` treats `C:` as an ordinary relative segment, so a
# `mkdir(parents=True)` on it silently builds a junk `./C:/Users/x` tree instead of failing (#235).
#
# Windows first, so a drive-qualified path is reported at full length rather than as the
# `/Users/x` nested inside it.
#
# A home directory is absolute: `/home/x` starts at the filesystem root, so its slash is never
# preceded by a path segment. `../components/home/Hero.astro` names a project folder that happens
# to be called `home`, and reading it as a user called "Hero.astro" would block ordinary source
# code (the site's Home-page components live in `src/components/home/`, #454).
