"""Fit every variant in one batch, and publish what was excluded (design §12, P2; #40).

This is the multi-variant entry point. It exists to make one property true: **every variant that
goes in comes out either as a saved fit or as a row in the exclusion list.** A variant that
merely fails to appear is the outcome §12 forbids, because a consumer cannot tell a refused
variant from one with no data.

Fits are saved with `save_fit` so figures, national rollups and validation can be produced later
without repeating the inference — a palette change should not cost nine minutes of NUTS.

#: Per-variant prior sd on log lengthscale, where the default does not suit the variant.
#:
#: This is a **prior belief about the biology stated per variant**, not a tuning knob, so it lives
#: here in the open rather than in a CLI flag someone forgets to pass. The default (0.7, roughly
#: 220-3,400 km at 95%) suits a variant whose data pins the correlation range down; HbS does, and
#: is deliberately absent from this table.
#:
#: G6PD does not. Its deficiency phenotype pools ~200 alleles with different geographic origins —
#: A- across Africa, Mediterranean through the Middle East and South Asia, Mahidol in Southeast
#: Asia — so no single spatial scale describes their sum, and the chains slide along the ridge
#: where a very long lengthscale is indistinguishable from `intercept`. Measured: r_hat 1.469 at
#: the default, versus r_hat passing and ESS rising 8 -> 111 at 0.4 with everything else equal
#: (#116). Narrowing the prior asserts the field is spatial rather than constant; it does not
#: assert the composite is a good model, which #116 still questions.
LENGTHSCALE_SIGMA: dict[str, float] = {"phenotype:g6pd-deficiency": 0.4}

#: Sampling budget per chain, used for warm-up and for retained draws alike. 1,200 is what the
#: HbS parity run converged with (docs/research/hbs-piel-parity-2026-09-16.md) and what the
#: data-store rebuild passes (docs/data-store.md). The previous default, 400, is the budget at
#: which HbS missed the ESS floor at 199 and G6PD never mixed (#111), so a run that omitted
#: --draws reproduced a known failure.
