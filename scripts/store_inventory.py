"""Inventory the local data and model store, with checksums (design §5).

    python scripts/store_inventory.py --root data --out data/store/INVENTORY.json

Answers one question: **what do we hold, and would we know if it went missing or changed?**

Most of what this project produces is gitignored — fetched sources are versioned upstream and
model fits are too large and too environment-coupled to commit — so the repository is not a record
of what exists. Three separate runs have already had their output destroyed with the pod that made
it. A checksummed inventory is the cheapest thing that turns "it is probably on the laptop" into a
statement that can be verified, and it is what a later move to remote storage would be checked
against.

Checksums are over content, not mtime: a file that silently changed is the failure worth catching,
and a timestamp cannot see it.

This describes only what is on this disk. The record of what was *published* is the committed
release manifest, ``data/releases/<release>.json`` (data store design 2026-10-17 §5), which lists
every object in the public data store with its sha256; ``scripts/fetch_data.py --verify-local``
checks local files against it, and ``scripts/fetch_data.py`` fetches what is missing.
